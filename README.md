Blockchain-Based Product Traceability System
Overview

The Blockchain-Based Product Traceability System is a secure and transparent platform designed to track products across the supply chain. By integrating blockchain technology with a modern web application, the system ensures authenticity, accountability, and trust from manufacturers to end consumers.

Problem Statement

In traditional supply chains, product tracking is often fragmented, opaque, and vulnerable to tampering. Consumers cannot easily verify product authenticity, and businesses face challenges in maintaining transparent and reliable records. This lack of visibility can lead to counterfeit products, data manipulation, and reduced consumer trust.

Our Solution

Our system leverages blockchain technology to create immutable product records. Each product is registered on the blockchain and assigned a unique QR code, allowing stakeholders to track its journey and verify its authenticity at any stage.

The platform provides role-based access to ensure secure operations while maintaining transparency across the supply chain.

Key Features
